# SpotifyMock
A simple mockup of Spotify's artist page. I attempted to make it as "alive" as possible with a user and friends list that will randomly generate everytime you refresh the page as well as generate a random song for them to be listening to. It will also give them a random sorted time between 1 hour and 3 days to help simulate an active friends list. The page also features a working music player with a single song that can be played, paused, and the volume adjusted. 

## APIs
[Napster's](https://developer.prod.napster.com/api/v2.2) API was used to generate random artists and albums for friend activity. 


[Randomuser.me](https://randomuser.me/) was used togenerate random picutres and names for users.

## Artist Credit
[Human Target Practice by Hail The Sun](https://hailthesun.bandcamp.com/album/wake) is the song used for the audio player.

Please dont sue me.
