# SpotifyMock
A simple mockup of Spotify's artist page. I attempted to make it as "alive" as possible with a user and friends list that will randomly generate everytime you refresh the page as well as generate a random song for them to be listening to. It will also give them a random sorted time between 1 hour and 3 days to help simulate an active friends list. The page also features a working music player with a single song that can be played, paused, and the volume adjusted.
